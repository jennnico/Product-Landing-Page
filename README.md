# Product-Landing-Page

This assignment was recently added to FreeCodeCamp. I completed it with using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery.

This page includes an embedded video, an input field that submits to a static webpage, a navbar, 2 media queries, and a CSS flexbox.

Javascript methods .hide() and .fadeIn() allow pages to fade in and out.
